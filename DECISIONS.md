# DocMind Service - Decisions & Engineering Notes

Decisions are logged as they are made, with the evidence available at the time. Rejected alternatives are listed because they are part of the decision.

## Decisions

### Decision: Project 7 builds a service on top of DocMind instead of a new RAG system
- Context: Project 6 measured three pipelines on 20 questions. Answer quality was a tie within noise (22, 23 and 22 of 26 key facts, strict), the multi-agent version used about 2.3 times the prompt tokens of the single call on document questions, and retrieval, not orchestration, caused the one real failure (see Project 6 `evaluation/RESULTS.md`).
- Chosen: spend Project 7 on what a measured RAG system lacks to be used: an API contract, storage, tests and CI gates, deployment, security and observability. The default query mode will be a single call; multi-agent stays an opt-in mode.
- Rejected: adding more agents or features to the pipeline (no measured benefit); hybrid search and a reranker here (they are the Project 9 stage on the shared evaluation curve; Project 7 stays hybrid-ready with a keyword column and a retriever interface).
- Tradeoff accepted: the service reuses a pipeline whose evaluation document is famous, so answer quality cannot be separated from model memory until Project 9 adds a held-out document.
- Would revisit if: the service-level evaluation (M8) contradicts the Project 6 findings.

### Decision: hosting path B, Render free web service plus Neon free Postgres
- Context: the budget is zero and no payment card is available. Free-tier options were checked on 2026-10-27. Hugging Face documents that Docker Spaces on the free CPU tier need a subscription; Google Cloud Run needs a billing account; Koyeb needs a card for verification; Fly.io has no free tier for new accounts; Oracle Always Free needs a card and has capacity limits. Render's free web service needs no card (512 MB RAM, spins down after 15 minutes idle) and Neon's free plan needs no card (0.5 GB per project, 100 compute-hours a month, scale to zero after 5 minutes, pgvector supported).
- Chosen: Render free plus Neon free, with a slim image (ONNX embeddings instead of PyTorch) to fit 512 MB. Render's current terms are checked at signup because a plan change on 1 August 2026 was reported.
- Rejected: Hugging Face Docker Space (paid); Cloud Run (card); Koyeb and Fly.io (card); Oracle Always Free (card, capacity).
- Tradeoff accepted: cold starts (idle spin-down and database scale-to-zero) and a hard 512 MB memory budget.
- Would revisit if: Render's terms no longer fit. The fallback is to publish the image to GHCR and have CI deploy an ephemeral stack and run the smoke test; that would be described as verified in CI, not hosted.

### Decision: a dedicated Python 3.12 environment instead of the shared `rag` environment
- Context: in Project 6, installing the pinned requirements into the shared `rag` environment downgraded numpy 2.2.6 to 1.26.4, transformers 5.16.1 to 4.57.6, langchain 1.3.18 to 0.3.7, langgraph 1.2.11 to 0.2.39, streamlit 1.63.0 to 1.39.0 and faiss-cpu 1.15.0 to 1.9.0, and pip reported dependency conflicts (see Project 6 `DECISIONS.md`).
- Chosen: a new conda environment at `B:\Applications\MiniConda\envs\docmind-service` with Python 3.12, and pinned `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` written from the versions installed at M1.
- Rejected: reusing `rag`.
- Tradeoff accepted: one more environment to maintain and extra disk space.
- Would revisit if: disk space becomes a problem.

### Decision: contract first
- Context: the service has to be usable by clients and testable before its behavior exists.
- Chosen: Pydantic schemas and stub routes that return `501` problem details define the API; `openapi.json` is committed and a test fails if the app drifts from it; every error uses `application/problem+json`. API keys are declared in the contract now and enforced from M6. Evidence: `tests/test_contract.py` and `openapi.json` in the M1 commit.
- Rejected: generating the contract only at the end (changes would not be visible in review).
- Tradeoff accepted: extra churn when a schema changes, since `openapi.json` must be regenerated in the same commit.
- Would revisit if: the contract file creates more friction than review value.
